# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems. The goal is to strengthen data structures, algorithms, and multi-language problem‑solving skills.

## 📁 Structure

Each problem has its own folder:

```
leetcode/
 ┣ 001-two-sum/
 ┃ ┣ java/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ Solution.java
 ┃ ┣ python/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ solution.py
 ┃ ┣ js/
 ┃ ┃ ┗ solution.js
 ┃ ┗ README.md
```

### Why this structure?

* All solutions for one problem stay together
* Easy to compare approaches between languages
* Clean and scalable organization

## 🏷️ Problem Folder Format

Each problem directory contains:

* `solution.<lang>` — code file per language

## ✅ Commit Style

Use meaningful commit messages:

```
add: Two Sum in Java
add: Python solution for Valid Anagram

```

## 🧭 Learning Focus

* Arrays & Hashmaps
* Two Pointers
